            <p>The first bilingual Japanese kanji dictionary designed to truly help learners accurately identify meaning and phonetic radicals. Creating a project like this inspired me to learn programming (HTML, CSS, JavaScript, Python) and explore AI. If you'd like to support the development of Radical, <a style="color: #00b4d8" href="https://paypal.me/carloscoordinator?country.x=ES&locale.x=en_US">you can donate here</a>. You can also book a free trial Japanese class with me <a style="color: #00b4d8" href="https://zcal.co/carloscoordinator/japanese">here</a> or find out what I'm up to on <a style="color: #00b4d8" href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/carlosramosfuentes/">LinkedIn</a>, <a style="color: #00b4d8" href="https://www.youtube.com/@CarlosCoordinator?sub_confirmation=1">YouTube</a> or <a style="color: #00b4d8" href="https://www.tiktok.com/@carloscoordinator">TikTok</a> or <a style="color: #00b4d8" href="https://www.instagram.com/carloscoordinator/">Instagram</a>.</p>
            <br>
            <p>Radicals are the building blocks of kanji. Some radicals show the meaning, while others indicate the <strong>on’yomi</strong> reading, used when two kanji are together. For example, 泊まる means "to stay" and is read とまる. When 泊 is next to another kanji, it's read ハク, because it contains the phonetic radical 白. Similarly, 伯, 迫, and 拍 are read ハク but have different meanings based on their meaning radicals. None of them have to do with 'white'.</p>
            <br>
            <p><strong>*Version 12</strong> [released Oct 26, 2025] added the Vocabulary Tab on the Google Play app, where learners can study their vocabulary with interactive quizzes and keep up with their study progress.
